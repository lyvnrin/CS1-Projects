# 1st-Year CS Projects

Welcome to my **first-year computer science projects repository**!  
This repo contains a collection of my work across different modules during my first year of university. Each module folder contains main courseworks and some mini exercises.

## 📂 Modules Overview
- **CS1811 OOP I**
- **CS1812 OOP II**
- **CS1822 Programming Fundamentals**
- **CS1840 Internet Services**
- **CS1860 Mathematical Structures**
- **CS1870 Machine Fundamentals**
- **CS1890 Software Design**

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository serves as a **portfolio of my first-year work**, showcasing my learning journey in programming, web development, and computational mathematics. It highlights not only the solutions but also my understanding of **problem-solving, algorithms, and design concepts**.

## 📝 How to Explore

1. Browse the folders for each module.  
2. Open subfolders to view individual assignments or projects.  
3. Each subfolder may contain:
   - Code files (`.py`, `.html`, `.js`, etc.)  
   - Notes or instructions (`README.md`)  
   - Screenshots or visuals if applicable
